My name is **Pijus Vaškevičius**, and this is my personal blog.  

I am self-taught developer from Vilnius, Lithuania. 

When learning to code, I went in many different directions, at first I tried to learn C#. But after several months I got several requests for websites and decided to pivot to web development.
To begin with I did ruby on rails courses at [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/) and after several websites finished as a freelancer I did [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/). I was excited to do it, because it had some introductions for working with node.js.
